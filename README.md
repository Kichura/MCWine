3. Open the ZIP file you have downloaded from step one,
4. Copy the MCWine-XXXX folder from ZIP to .minecraft/versions folder, if asked - replace the files,
5. Restart your minecraft launcher,
6. Create a new installation instance by heading to "Installations" and choosing the + icon,

## Installing This Modpack (PolyMC Method)

1. [**Click here to download the development version,**](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine/archive/refs/heads/PolyMC-Dev.zip)
2. Drag the ZIP into the PolyMC window,
3. Make sure the installed instance has Java 17 or greater installed.

## Updating Java Version (Optional)

It is recommended that you use [Java 19 (Lite JDK)](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-19-current) to allow minecraft to make use of the latest java version.

*Although now requires ```javacheck.jar``` to be deleted as reported in [MCL-18306](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-18306). (But if you use PolyMC instead then skip the ```javacheck.jar``` removal requirement)*

## JVM Arguments (Optional)

It is recommended that you use [one of these specific scripts](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine/tree/PolyMC-Dev/sources/jvm_arguments.md) as your JVM arguments instead of the defaults.

*(You can change the ```-Xmx2G``` including ```-Xms2G``` value from the pastebin in order to manage the game RAM on how much to use for Minecraft, But depends on your computer's hardware; Both of those are not needed in PolyMC however as it uses it's own configurators for that)*
