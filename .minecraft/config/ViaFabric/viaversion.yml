# ViaVersion configuration goes here,
#
# This allows the entire compatibility system to be re-configured in most cases when
# viaversion is involved in older servers and require translation towards newer clients,
# but can also work out with certain older clients where other modes are absolutely necessary.
#
# References to every config detail can be discovered here:
# https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion/blob/master/common/src/main/resources/assets/viaversion/config.yml
#
# (Not everything listed in the default config itself are included as ViaFabric automatically cuts them for various reasons)
#
#
# Update configuration goes here.
#
check-for-updates: false
#
# Supported version ping configuration goes here.
#
send-supported-versions: true
#
# Versions we should not support for this client, there are multiple reasons why we do this:
#
# 1. The specific versions constantly create connection errors and fail to establish a proper connection.
# 2. There are multiple bugs left-and-right that these versions have which causes inconsistent performance, issues with gameplay, etc.
# 3. Support for these have been longly dropped similar to hypixel's approach back in febuary 2nd 2022; hence this was followed along.
