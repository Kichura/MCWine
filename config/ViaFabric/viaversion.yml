#
# Versions we should not support for this client, there are multiple reasons why we do this:
#
# 1. The specific versions constantly create connection errors and fail to establish a proper connection,
# 2. There are multiple bugs left-and-right that these versions have which causes inconsistent performance, issues with gameplay, etc.
# 3. Support for these have been dropped since similar to hypixel's approach; hence the reason why we also follow along.
